<h1>The Best Movies According to Ifeanyi</h1>
<h2>My Top 10 favourite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>The most thought-provoking sci-fi movie ever made.</p>
<h3>When Harry Mest Sally</h3>
<p>Easily the best movie I have ever watched. <br /> I have seen this movie more times than I can remember, and I'm always glued to the screen listening to, and following along with, the conversations.</p>
<h3>Leave Yesterday Behind</h3>
<p>An old romance movie, but it made a lasting impact on me.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Sense</h3>
<p>I don't know anyone who didn't have to watch this movie, at least, twice before understanding it. <br /> Arguably my best by Bruce Willis.</p>
<h3>The Gods Must Be Crazy</h3>
<p>A love story sparked by the scorching heat of the Kalahari desert.</p>
<h3>The Good, The Bad and The Urgly</h3>
<p>A classic western. The standard that must be met and surpassed to catch and hold my attention.</p>
<h3>The Davinci Code</h3>
<p>If you are interested in mystery thrillers and the secrets behind secret societies, this movie is the place to start.</p>
<h3>Angels and Demons</h3>
<p>After the Davinci Code, find this and watch it. That's all I can say.</p>
<h3>The Devil's Advocate</h3>
<p>This thought-provoking and intense film that explores good and evil, power and ambition, is way up on the list of my very best movies. <br /> 
    It's a block-buster. Al Pacino at his very best.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p>I came to believe that, for a fact, whether we succeed or fail, make progress or retrogress, most of it sterm from within our minds. <br> The human mind is truly God's most wonderful creation.</p>
